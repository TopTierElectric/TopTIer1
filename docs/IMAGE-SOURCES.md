## Verification scope for this ledger

- Scope checked: image files referenced from top-level `*.html` pages and served from `assets/images/`.
- Externally sourced images identified in current page usage: `assets/images/hero.jpg` and `assets/images/projects/myenergi-4SyUf9MvWjU-unsplash.jpg`.
- Remaining project gallery/service images appear to be first-party job photos (local naming + repository context) and are therefore not included in this external-source ledger.
