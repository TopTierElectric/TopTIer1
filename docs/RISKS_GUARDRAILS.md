# Risks & Guardrails

## Do NOT do the following
- **No fake review claims:** Do not invent ratings, counts, or testimonials without source data.
- **No thin location spam:** Do not create templated city pages with duplicate copy; use a single service areas hub with unique blurbs.
- **No heavy hero video/slider:** Avoid assets that harm Core Web Vitals.
- **No tech stack rewrite:** Keep the static HTML/CSS/JS stack unless a lightweight change is necessary.
- **No warranty overpromises:** Only state warranties/guarantees that can be verified.
- **No unsupported proof claims:** Any “licensed/insured/years in business” claim must be paired with a verifiable proof object.

## Performance guardrails
- Keep scripts minimal and defer non-critical JS.
- Use optimized images with explicit dimensions.
- Lazy-load below-fold media.

## SEO guardrails
- Single H1 per page.
- Unique title + meta description for each indexable page.
- Canonical tags present and accurate.

## Conversion guardrails
- One primary CTA per page plus a secondary “Call” CTA.
- Trust stack on every money page (license, insurance clarity, warranty object, reviews proof, photos, process, risk reversal).
