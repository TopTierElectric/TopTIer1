# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please responsible disclose by emailing
`security@toptier-electric.example.com` with steps to reproduce, impact,
and any suggested mitigations.  Do **not** create a public issue.

We aim to respond to security reports within 72 hours.  Once the
vulnerability has been addressed and a fix has been deployed, we will
work with you to coordinate public disclosure.
