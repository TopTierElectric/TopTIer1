        <h2>Meet the Owner</h2>
        <h3>Carl Nystrom — Owner-Operator, Top Tier Electrical</h3>
        <p>Hi — I'm <strong>Carl Nystrom</strong>, the owner and operator of Top Tier Electrical.</p>
        <p>
          I built Top Tier Electrical to deliver a better electrical contractor experience:
          <strong>polite communication, clean code-correct work, and planning that helps clients avoid expensive rework later</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the business itself is new, I bring <strong>nearly a decade of experience in the electrical trade</strong> —
          the kind of experience you only get from real service calls, real upgrades, and real problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you reach out, you're not getting passed around between salespeople and crews. You get direct communication,
          realistic timelines, and work done to a standard you can feel confident about.

            <h3>Respect for your space</h3>

        <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
        <p>Top Tier Electrical serves customers across West Michigan who want the job done right the first time:</p>
        <h3>Homeowners</h3>
        <p>Service work, repairs, upgrades, EV charging, lighting, and planning for future loads — with clean finish work and clear communication.</p>
        <h3>Property managers &amp; small commercial spaces</h3>
        <p>Service, upgrades, maintenance, lighting retrofits, and troubleshooting planned around uptime, safety, and practical scheduling.</p>
        <h3>Builders, remodelers, and high-end projects</h3>

        <h2>Our Core Services</h2>
        <p>If you want the full scope details, each service below has a dedicated page on our site.</p>
        <h3>Panel Upgrades &amp; Service Upgrades</h3>
        <p>When the panel is outdated, out of space, or undersized for modern loads, a panel/service upgrade is often the foundation for safe expansion. We focus on <strong>permit-ready planning, tidy installs, clear labeling, and inspection-ready execution</strong>.</p>

        <h3>EV Charger Installation (Level 2)</h3>
        <p>Home charging should feel simple — plug in and wake up charged. The important part is making sure the <strong>circuit sizing, breaker protection, and panel capacity</strong> are planned correctly because EV charging is a high continuous load.</p>

        <h3>Lighting &amp; Fixtures</h3>
        <p>Lighting should look intentional and work the way it should. We plan <strong>placement, switching, dimming, and compatibility</strong> so the result is clean, functional, and reliable — inside and out.</p>
