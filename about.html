        <h2>Meet the Owner</h2>
        <h3>Carl Nystrom — Owner-Operator, Top Tier Electrical</h3>

        <p>
          Hi — I'm <strong>Carl Nystrom</strong>, the owner and operator of Top
          Tier Electrical.
        </p>

        <p>
          I built Top Tier Electrical to deliver a better electrical contractor
          experience:
          <strong
            >polite communication, clean code-correct work, and planning that
            helps clients avoid expensive rework later</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the business itself is new, I bring
          <strong>nearly a decade of experience in the electrical trade</strong>
          — the kind of experience you only get from real service calls, real
          upgrades, and real problem solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you reach out, you're not getting passed around between
          salespeople and crews. You get direct communication, realistic
          timelines, and work done to a standard you can feel confident about.

        <h2>What “Top Tier” Means in the Field</h2>
        <p>
          Electrical work isn't just about getting power back on. It's about
          making sure the system is
          <strong>safe, serviceable, and built to last</strong>.

            <h3>Clear scope before work begins</h3>
            <p>
              We explain what needs to happen, what it will solve, and what's
              outside the scope — so you can decide confidently.

              job is done.

        <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
        <p>
          Top Tier Electrical serves customers across West Michigan who want the
          job done right the first time:
        </p>
        <h3>Homeowners</h3>
        <p>
          Service work, repairs, upgrades, EV charging, lighting, and planning
          for future loads — with clean finish work and clear communication.
        </p>
        <h3>Property managers &amp; small commercial spaces</h3>
        <p>
          Service, upgrades, maintenance, lighting retrofits, and
          troubleshooting planned around uptime, safety, and practical
          scheduling.
        </p>
        <h3>Builders, remodelers, and high-end projects</h3>
        <p>
          Electrical design/consultation and planning support — especially when
          walls are open, change orders are expensive, or controls/loads are
          complex.
        </p>

      <section class="container card">
        <h2>Our Core Services</h2>
        <p>
          If you want the full scope details, each service below has a dedicated
          page on our site.
        </p>

        <h3>Panel Upgrades &amp; Service Upgrades</h3>
        <p>
          When the panel is outdated, out of space, or undersized for modern
          loads, a panel/service upgrade is often the foundation for safe
          expansion. We focus on
          <strong
            >permit-ready planning, tidy installs, clear labeling, and
            inspection-ready execution</strong
          >.

        <h3>EV Charger Installation (Level 2)</h3>
        <p>
          Home charging should feel simple — plug in and wake up charged. The
          important part is making sure the
          <strong
            >circuit sizing, breaker protection, and panel capacity</strong
          >
          are planned correctly because EV charging is a high continuous load.

        <h3>Lighting &amp; Fixtures</h3>
        <p>
          Lighting should look intentional and work the way it should. We plan
          <strong>placement, switching, dimming, and compatibility</strong> so
          the result is clean, functional, and reliable — inside and out.
        </p>
        <p>Learn more: /lighting</p>

        <h3>Electrical Repairs &amp; Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>
          Dead outlets, nuisance trips, partial power loss, flickering lights,
          warm devices — we troubleshoot safely, explain what we find, and
          outline clear fix options before work begins.
        </p>
        <p>Learn more: /electrical-repairs</p>

        <h3>Generator Sales &amp; Installation</h3>
        <p>
          Backup power should feel calm and predictable. We help you plan what
          you actually need to run during an outage, then install transfer
          equipment cleanly and safely with inspection-ready documentation where
          required.

          <li>
            <strong>Complete &amp; Walk Through</strong> — We complete the work,
