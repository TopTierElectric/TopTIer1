        <h2>Surges Are Everyday Events — Not Just Lightning</h2>
        <p>Most people think of “power surges” as rare events caused by lightning. The reality is much different. Surges happen <strong>every single day</strong> in every home — when your air conditioner kicks on, when your refrigerator cycles, or when the utility grid switches power. These little jolts quietly wear down the electronics and appliances you rely on, shortening their lifespan and sometimes destroying them outright.</p>

        <h2>Why It’s in the Code Now</h2>
        <p>Recognizing this risk, the <strong>2020 National Electrical Code (NEC)</strong> added a new requirement: all new residential construction must include a surge protection device (SPD). Michigan continued using the 2017 NEC until <strong>March 2024</strong>, when the state adopted the <strong>2023 NEC</strong> — which carries that same surge protection requirement forward. That means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Homes built or permitted after March 2024</strong> must include whole‑home surge protection.</li>
          <li><strong>Homes built before March 2024</strong> were never required to have it — and most still don’t.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But just because it wasn’t required doesn’t mean it isn’t important. In fact, adding a whole‑home surge protector is one of the simplest, most cost‑effective upgrades you can make for your home.</p>

        <h2>How Surge Protection Works</h2>
        <p>A surge protection device is installed at your home’s main electrical panel. When excess voltage comes down the line, the SPD safely diverts it to ground instead of letting it pass into your wiring and appliances. Think of it as a <strong>guardian for your entire electrical system</strong>. It works silently in the background, protecting your furnace, refrigerator, TV, computer, and smart home devices from sudden damage and gradual wear.</p>

        <h2>What About Lightning?</h2>
        <p>Here’s the truth:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nearby lightning strikes or utility surges?</strong> Yes — that’s exactly what a Type 2 SPD is designed to stop.</li>
          <li><strong>A direct lightning strike to your home?</strong> No residential device can absorb that much energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But here’s the key: <strong>the majority of damaging surges don’t come from direct lightning at all</strong>. They come from the power grid and from appliances cycling inside your home. Whole‑home surge protection eliminates those everyday threats.</p>

        <h2>Why It’s Worth It</h2>
        <p>The numbers tell the story:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A single furnace control board can cost <strong>$400–$800</strong> to replace.</li>
          <li>A refrigerator or washer: <strong>$1,000–$2,500+</strong>.</li>
          <li>Computers, TVs, and entertainment systems: easily thousands.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A whole‑home surge protector costs just a fraction of any one of those repairs — yet it protects them all at once. Unlike plug‑in strips, it guards <strong>every circuit, every outlet, and every device</strong> in your home. It’s a one‑time investment that often pays for itself the first time it saves you from an expensive breakdown.</p>

        <h2>Types of Surge Protectors</h2>
        <p>Surge protection devices are defined by the NEC in four types, but here’s the homeowner‑friendly breakdown:</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Type</th><th>Protects Against</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Type 1</strong></td><td>Utility‑side surges, including large grid events</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Type 2</strong></td><td>Both external and internal surges (best all‑around protection)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Type 3</strong></td><td>Small, localized surges — extra defense for sensitive electronics</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>For most homes, a <strong>Type 2 whole‑home SPD</strong> paired with a couple of quality plug‑in (Type 3) protectors at sensitive spots (like a home office or media center) gives excellent coverage.</p>

        <h2>Final Word</h2>
        <p>Surge protection isn’t about gadgets — it’s about <strong>protecting the heart of your home</strong>. The NEC now requires it in all new Michigan homes built or permitted after March 2024. If your home was built before then, chances are you don’t have it — but you can. For a modest, one‑time cost, you’ll protect every appliance and device in your home, bring your system up to today’s safety standards, and gain peace of mind every time the lights flicker or a storm rolls in.</p>
