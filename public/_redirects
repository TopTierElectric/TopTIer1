# Cloudflare Pages redirects file
#
# Only include legacy aliases and asset redirects. Do not attempt to force
# extensionless HTML canonicalisation; Cloudflare automatically serves
# `.html` files at extensionless routes and will redirect `/page.html` to `/page`.
#
# Syntax: [source] [destination] [code] (code optional, default 302).

## Legacy asset aliases

/images/logos/TopTierElectrical_Primary_FlatGold_512.webp /TopTierElectrical_Primary_FlatGold_512.png 301

## Legacy page aliases
# Map old URLs to their modern equivalents. Keep only rules that have a
# demonstrable purpose (for example, bookmarks or SEO history).
/home / 301
/about /services.html 301
/pricing /services.html 301

# Cloudflare Pages will serve /404.html for unmatched routes automatically.
