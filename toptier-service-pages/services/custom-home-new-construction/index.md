## What We Handle

### Planning + Layout

- Device and switch layouts that match real furniture use and traffic flow
- Lighting plans that actually _perform_ (layered lighting, dimming compatibility)
- Kitchen and island planning coordination (appliances, hood/MUA coordination as needed)
- Load planning for future additions (EV, hot tub, shop power, etc.)

### Rough-In

- Clean, straight runs and consistent box heights
- Proper nail plate protection, framing coordination, and clear routing
- Dedicated circuits where needed (kitchen, mechanicals, laundry, garage, etc.)
- Labeling discipline that makes trim + troubleshooting faster

### Trim + Finish

- Symmetry and spacing that looks intentional
- Dimming setups that avoid flicker/buzz and “dead” dimming ranges
- Panel directory that’s usable (not “lights 1 / lights 2”)
- Final checks and walkthrough-ready punch list

## How We Keep Your Build Moving

- **Trade coordination:** we don’t block drywall/inspections with unfinished details
- **Punch-list discipline:** fewer callbacks, faster close
- **Documentation mindset:** clear labeling and system organization helps everyone

## Common Add-Ons We Plan For Early

- EV charger rough-in or full install
- Generator readiness (transfer switch planning)
- Exterior power (landscape lighting, future patio features)
- Dedicated circuits for shop tools or outbuildings
- Low-voltage pathways (network, cameras, audio) where appropriate

## FAQ

**Do you work directly with builders?**  
Yes—builder coordination is part of how we keep timelines predictable.

**Can you wire from a lighting design or reflected ceiling plan?**  
Yes. If you have drawings, we build from them; if not, we can help create a practical layout.

**Do you handle inspections and permitting?**  
Where required, yes—permits and inspections are coordinated as part of the project.

**How do you avoid dimmer issues (flicker, buzzing, uneven dimming)?**  
By pairing fixtures/LED drivers with compatible controls and validating load characteristics before finalization.
