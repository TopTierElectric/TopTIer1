# Backup Power That Actually Works When You Need It

A generator isn’t “installed” when it starts—it’s installed when it **transfers correctly, carries the right loads, and runs safely**. We design and install standby generator systems that perform under real outage conditions.

## What We Handle

- Transfer switching integration
- Critical-load vs whole-home strategies
- Clean labeling and homeowner operation guidance
- Testing/commissioning mindset (verify what it will actually run)
