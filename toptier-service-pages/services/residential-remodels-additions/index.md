## The Top Tier Remodel Process
1. **Walkthrough + goals** (what you want to add, move, or clean up)
2. **Assess existing electrical** (panel capacity, grounding/bonding, circuit condition)
3. **Plan the cleanest path** (minimize drywall damage; coordinate with other trades)
4. **Install + test** (verify devices, protection, labeling)
5. **Finish-ready cleanup** (leave the space ready for the next trade)

## What “Clean Work” Means Here
- Protective prep (drop cloths, dust control approach)
- Thoughtful routing (so future access isn’t a nightmare)
- Code-correct protection (GFCI/AFCI where required)
- Clear labeling so the next service call is faster and cheaper

Often, yes—route choice depends on framing access and finished conditions.

**Do I need a panel upgrade for my remodel?**  
Not always. We evaluate load and capacity before recommending upgrades.
