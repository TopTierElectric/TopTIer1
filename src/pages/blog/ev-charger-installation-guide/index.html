  <h1>EV charger installation guide for homeowners</h1>
  <p>
    A quality EV charger install is about more than mounting hardware. Circuit
    design, load calculations, and cable routing all matter.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify panel capacity before choosing charger amperage.</li>
    <li>
      Select a charger location that balances convenience and cable reach.
    </li>
    <li>Plan for weather exposure and future vehicle changes.</li>
    <li>
      Use permitted, code-compliant installation for safety and resale value.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Proper planning avoids rework and helps your charger perform reliably in all
    seasons.
