  <h1>Signs you may need an electrical panel upgrade</h1>
  <p>
    Modern homes ask more from electrical systems than ever before. If your
    panel is overloaded or aging, you may see warning signs before a failure.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Breakers trip when using common appliances.</li>
    <li>There is no room for new circuits.</li>
    <li>You still have a fuse box or an obsolete panel model.</li>
    <li>You're adding EV charging, HVAC upgrades, or workshop equipment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A panel assessment helps determine whether a targeted circuit update or full
    service upgrade is the right next step.
