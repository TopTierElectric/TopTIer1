  <p>
    Most electrical hazards build slowly. Frequent breaker trips, warm outlets,
    and flickering lights are all early signals worth taking seriously.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Test GFCI outlets monthly in kitchens, baths, garages, and outdoors.</li>
    <li>Replace damaged cords and avoid permanent use of extension cords.</li>
    <li>Never ignore a breaker that repeatedly trips under normal load.</li>
    <li>Schedule an inspection if lights dim when large appliances start.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you notice any of these warning signs, a licensed electrician can help
    isolate the root cause safely.
