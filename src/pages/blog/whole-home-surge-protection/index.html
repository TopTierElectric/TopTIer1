  <h1>Whole-home surge protection: what it does</h1>
  <p>
    Surges can come from utility events and large equipment cycling on/off in
    the home. A panel-mounted surge device helps protect sensitive electronics.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It complements-not replaces-point-of-use surge strips.</li>
    <li>It helps protect appliances, controls, and smart home components.</li>
    <li>It should be matched to panel configuration and electrical demand.</li>
    <li>Periodic inspection ensures wiring and grounding remain in good shape.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If your home has frequent storm activity or expensive electronics, this is a
    practical layer of protection.
