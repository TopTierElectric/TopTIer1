  <h1>How to choose the right electrician</h1>
  <p>
    The best outcomes come from clear expectations and licensed workmanship-not
    just the lowest quote.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm licensing, insurance, and permit familiarity.</li>
    <li>Ask for a clear scope: what is included, excluded, and scheduled.</li>
    <li>Check communication speed and whether recommendations are explained.</li>
    <li>Look for clean, code-aware installations in project photos or reviews.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A reputable contractor should make the process understandable from estimate
    to final walkthrough.
