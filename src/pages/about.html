  <h2>Meet the Owner</h2>
  <h3>Carl Nystrom — Owner-Operator, Top Tier Electrical</h3>

  <p>
    Hi — I’m <strong>Carl Nystrom</strong>, the owner and operator of Top Tier
    Electrical.
  </p>

  <p>
    I built Top Tier Electrical to deliver a better electrical contractor
    experience:
    <strong
      >polite communication, clean code-correct work, and planning that helps
      clients avoid expensive rework later</strong
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the business itself is new, I bring
    <strong>nearly a decade of experience in the electrical trade</strong> — the
    kind of experience you only get from real service calls, real upgrades, and
    real problem solving.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you reach out, you’re not getting passed around between salespeople and
    crews. You get direct communication, realistic timelines, and work done to a
    standard you can feel confident about.
  </p>

  <h2>What “Top Tier” Means in the Field</h2>
  <p>
    Electrical work isn’t just about getting power back on. It’s about making
    sure the system is
    <strong>safe, serviceable, and built to last</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>Here’s what you can expect from us:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Clear scope before work begins</strong><br />
      We explain what needs to happen, what it will solve, and what’s outside
      the scope — so you can decide confidently.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Respect for your space</strong><br />
      Floors protected, wiring kept tidy, work area cleaned up when the job is
      done.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Code-aware workmanship</strong><br />
      Installations and repairs are done with safety and current electrical
      standards in mind.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Owner-operated accountability</strong><br />
      The person you talk to is the person responsible for the outcome.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2-Year workmanship warranty</strong><br />
      We stand behind our work because you shouldn’t have to worry after the job
      is complete.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
  <p>
    Top Tier Electrical serves customers across West Michigan who want the job
    done right the first time:
  </p>

  <h3>Homeowners</h3>
  <p>
    Service work, repairs, upgrades, EV charging, lighting, and planning for
    future loads — with clean finish work and clear communication.
  </p>

  <h3>Property managers &amp; small commercial spaces</h3>
  <p>
    Service, upgrades, maintenance, lighting retrofits, and troubleshooting
    planned around uptime, safety, and practical scheduling.
  </p>

  <h3>Builders, remodelers, and high-end projects</h3>
  <p>
    Electrical design/consultation and planning support — especially when walls
    are open, change orders are expensive, or controls/loads are complex.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Core Services</h2>
  <p>
    If you want the full scope details, each service below has a dedicated page
    on our site.
  </p>

  <h3>Panel Upgrades &amp; Service Upgrades</h3>
  <p>
    When the panel is outdated, out of space, or undersized for modern loads, a
    panel/service upgrade is often the foundation for safe expansion. We focus
    on
    <strong
      >permit-ready planning, tidy installs, clear labeling, and
      inspection-ready execution</strong
    >.
  </p>

  <h3>EV Charger Installation (Level 2)</h3>
  <p>
    Home charging should feel simple — plug in and wake up charged. The
    important part is making sure the
    <strong>circuit sizing, breaker protection, and panel capacity</strong> are
    planned correctly because EV charging is a high continuous load.
  </p>

  <h3>Lighting &amp; Fixtures</h3>
  <p>
    Lighting should look intentional and work the way it should. We plan
    <strong>placement, switching, dimming, and compatibility</strong>
    so the result is clean, functional, and reliable — inside and out.
  </p>
  <p>Learn more: <a href="/lighting">/lighting</a></p>

  <h3>Electrical Repairs &amp; Troubleshooting</h3>
  <p>
    Dead outlets, nuisance trips, partial power loss, flickering lights, warm
    devices — we troubleshoot safely, explain what we find, and outline clear
    fix options before work begins.
  </p>

  <h3>Generator Sales &amp; Installation</h3>
  <p>
    Backup power should feel calm and predictable. We help you plan what you
    actually need to run during an outage, then install transfer equipment
    cleanly and safely with inspection-ready documentation where required.

  <h2>Our Process</h2>
  <h3>Diagnose → Explain → Scope → Execute &amp; Verify</h3>

  <p>
    Our process is designed to eliminate the two biggest frustrations in
    electrical work: <strong>guessing</strong> and
    <strong>unclear scope</strong>.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Listen &amp; Diagnose</strong><br />
      We start by understanding symptoms and checking the system for a safe,
      accurate diagnosis.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plan the Fix</strong><br />
      You get clear options, scope boundaries, and a plan for routing,
      materials, and safety.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Complete &amp; Walk Through</strong><br />
      We complete the work, test circuits, and walk you through what changed and
      how to use it.
    </li>
  </ol>
