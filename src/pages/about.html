  <h2>Meet the Owner</h2>
  <h3>Carl Nystrom — Owner‑Operator, Top Tier Electrical</h3>

  <p>
    Hi — I’m <strong>Carl Nystrom</strong>, the owner and operator of Top Tier
    Electrical.
  </p>

  <p>
    I built Top Tier Electrical to deliver a better electrical contractor
    experience:
    <strong
      >polite communication, clean code‑correct work, and planning that helps
      clients avoid expensive rework later</strong
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the business itself is new, I bring
    <strong>nearly a decade of experience in the electrical trade</strong> — the
    kind of experience you only get from real service calls, real upgrades, and
    real problem solving.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you reach out, you’re not getting passed around between salespeople and
    crews. You get direct communication, realistic timelines, and work done to a
    standard you can feel confident about.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>What “Top Tier” Means in the Field</h2>
  <p>
    Electrical work isn’t just about getting power back on. It’s about making
    sure the system is
    <strong>safe, serviceable, and built to last</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>Here’s what you can expect from us:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Clear scope before work begins</strong><br />
      We explain what needs to happen, what it will solve, and what’s outside
      the scope — so you can decide confidently.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Respect for your space</strong><br />
      Floors protected, wiring kept tidy, work area cleaned up when the job is
      done.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Code‑aware workmanship</strong><br />
      Installations and repairs are done with safety and current electrical
      standards in mind.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Owner‑operated accountability</strong><br />
      The person you talk to is the person responsible for the outcome.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2‑Year workmanship warranty</strong><br />
      We stand behind our work because you shouldn’t have to worry after the job
      is complete.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
  <p>
    Top Tier Electrical serves customers across West Michigan who want the job
    done right the first time:
  </p>

  <h3>Homeowners</h3>
  <p>
    Service work, repairs, upgrades, EV charging, lighting, and planning for
    future loads — with clean finish work and clear communication.
  </p>

  <h3>Property managers &amp; small commercial spaces</h3>
  <p>
    Service, upgrades, maintenance, lighting retrofits, and troubleshooting
    planned around uptime, safety, and practical scheduling.
  </p>

  <h3>Builders, remodelers, and high‑end projects</h3>
  <p>
    Electrical design/consultation and planning support — especially when walls
    are open, change orders are expensive, or controls/loads are complex.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Our Core Services</h2>
  <p>
    If you want the full scope details, each service below has a dedicated page
    on our site.
  </p>

  <h3>Panel Upgrades &amp; Service Upgrades</h3>
  <p>
    When the panel is outdated, out of space, or undersized for modern loads, a
    panel/service upgrade is often the foundation for safe expansion. We focus
    on
    <strong
      >permit‑ready planning, tidy installs, clear labeling, and
      inspection‑ready execution</strong
    >.
  </p>
  <p>Learn more: /panel-upgrades</p>

  <h3>EV Charger Installation (Level 2)</h3>
  <p>
    Home charging should feel simple — plug in and wake up charged. The
    important part is making sure the
    <strong>circuit sizing, breaker protection, and panel capacity</strong> are
    planned correctly because EV charging is a high continuous load.
  </p>
  <p>Learn more: /ev-chargers</p>

  <h3>Lighting &amp; Fixtures</h3>
  <p>
    Lighting should look intentional and work the way it should. We plan
    <strong>placement, switching, dimming, and compatibility</strong> so the
    result is clean, functional, and reliable — inside and out.
  </p>
  <p>Learn more: /lighting</p>

  <h3>Electrical Repairs &amp; Troubleshooting</h3>
  <p>
    Dead outlets, nuisance trips, partial power loss, flickering lights, warm
    devices — we troubleshoot safely, explain what we find, and outline clear
    fix options before work begins.
  </p>
  <p>Learn more: /electrical-repairs</p>

  <h3>Generator Sales &amp; Installation</h3>
  <p>
    Backup power should feel calm and predictable. We help you plan what you
    actually need to run during an outage, then install transfer equipment
    cleanly and safely with inspection‑ready documentation where required.
  </p>
  <p>Learn more: /generators</p>

  <h3>Energy Solutions &amp; Energy Consulting</h3>
  <p>
    If you want clarity before spending, we provide practical, priority‑based
    planning for efficiency, comfort, and future readiness (EVs, remodels,
    workshops, generator planning).

    phased lighting upgrades designed to reduce downtime, improve visibility,
    and deliver clean documentation for handoffs.

  <h2>Our Process</h2>
  <h3>Diagnose → Explain → Scope → Execute &amp; Verify</h3>

  <p>
    Our process is designed to eliminate the two biggest frustrations in
    electrical work:
    <strong>guessing</strong> and <strong>unclear scope</strong>.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Listen &amp; Diagnose</strong><br />
      We start by understanding symptoms and checking the system for a safe,
      accurate diagnosis.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plan the Fix</strong><br />
      You get clear options, scope boundaries, and a plan for routing,
      materials, and safety.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Complete &amp; Walk Through</strong><br />
      We complete the work, test circuits, and walk you through what changed and
      how to use it.
    </li>
  </ol>
