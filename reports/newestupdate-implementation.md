# NewestUpdate implementation review

## Outcome
- `origin/NewestUpdate` matches `origin/main` with no file-level differences, so there are no additional files or updates to implement onto `main`.
- Removed the previously generated NewestUpdate file inventory report to avoid redundant artifacts.

## Evidence
- Compared `origin/main` to `origin/NewestUpdate` using `git diff --name-status origin/main..origin/NewestUpdate` and observed no changes.
