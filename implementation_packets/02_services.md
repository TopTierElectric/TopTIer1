# Services Hub (/services.html)

## Exact Problem
Services page listed offerings without dedicated detail pages and contained unverifiable claims.

## Why it matters
Service hub must route users to single-intent pages to avoid cannibalization and confusion.

## Exact Fix
Rebuilt service grid with links to eight dedicated pages, added pricing clarity note and booking CTA, updated metadata and LocalBusiness schema.

## Where to apply
services.html

## Acceptance Criteria
All services listed have dedicated pages and links resolve; pricing note present; single H1.

## Verification Steps
- rg "service-card" services.html
- rg "Book service" services.html
