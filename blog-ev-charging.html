      <h1>EV Charging at Home</h1>
      <p>A clear, practical guide to home charging setup and what to expect before installation.</p>
    </div>

  <article class="blog-post">
    <div class="container">
      <p>Home charging is one of the best parts of owning an EV, but the setup should be planned carefully. This guide explains the differences between Level 1 and Level 2 charging, what an electrician checks before installation, and how to decide if your electrical panel needs attention.</p>

      <h2>Level 1 vs. Level 2 Charging</h2>
      <p>Level 1 charging uses a standard 120V outlet. It’s simple but slow, which can be fine for short daily commutes or plug-in hybrids. Level 2 charging uses a dedicated 240V circuit and charges faster, making it the most common choice for households that drive regularly. Most homeowners find Level 2 charging provides enough overnight range without relying on public stations.</p>

      <h2>What an Electrician Checks Before Installation</h2>
      <p>Before any charger is installed, a few key checks help confirm a safe setup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Panel capacity:</strong> Is there space and capacity for a new two‑pole breaker?</li>
        <li><strong>Routing:</strong> What is the cleanest path from the panel to the charger location?</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Is the charger inside a garage, on an exterior wall, or in a detached building?</li>
        <li><strong>Existing loads:</strong> Are there other major appliances that affect available capacity?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is why a site assessment is important—it keeps the install safe and avoids surprises.</p>

      <h2>Why Dedicated Circuits Matter</h2>
      <p>EV chargers are continuous loads, which means the circuit must be sized and protected correctly. A dedicated circuit helps prevent overheating and nuisance trips. It also ensures the charger performs consistently without interfering with other household loads.</p>

      <h2>Hardwired vs. Plug-In Chargers</h2>
      <p>Both options can work well, but the choice depends on your setup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardwired chargers</strong> are permanently installed and typically look cleaner. They are a good choice for long-term use in a fixed location.</li>
        <li><strong>Plug‑in chargers</strong> use a receptacle (like a garage outlet) and can be moved later, but they still need a properly sized circuit and safe wiring.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An electrician can help decide which option fits your space and charging habits.</p>

      <h2>When a Panel Upgrade Might Be Needed</h2>
      <p>Not every home needs a panel upgrade for EV charging. However, if your panel is already full, has limited capacity, or is outdated, a service correction might be the safest path. If you’re unsure, the <a href="panel-upgrades.html">panel upgrade page</a> explains common signs and what a typical scope includes.</p>

      <h2>Common Home Charging Scenarios</h2>
      <p>Every property is different, but these are common setups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attached garage:</strong> The most straightforward layout, with a short run from the panel.</li>
        <li><strong>Detached garage:</strong> Requires longer routing or trenching, which can impact scope.</li>
        <li><strong>Two EVs:</strong> May require load sharing or careful circuit planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Home plus workshop:</strong> The charger may share capacity with other tools or equipment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What a Typical Installation Includes</h2>
      <p>An EV charger installation usually covers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review of available capacity and circuit needs.</li>
        <li>Routing and mounting of the charger in the agreed location.</li>
        <li>Dedicated circuit wiring and proper breaker protection.</li>
        <li>Testing and a walkthrough of basic use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Scope details vary based on the charger location, distance from the panel, and any safety corrections found during inspection.</p>

      <h2>How to Prepare for an EV Charger Install</h2>
      <p>To make the process easier, gather a few details before your appointment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The model of charger you want (if already chosen).</li>
        <li>Where you want the charger mounted.</li>
        <li>Any planned future additions, like a second EV or workshop equipment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re still deciding on equipment, an electrician can explain what specs matter most, such as amperage, mounting style, and cord length.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>If you’re ready for home charging, start with a scope review so you know exactly what’s involved. The <a href="ev-chargers.html">EV charger installation service page</a> outlines the process in more detail and covers common questions.</p>
