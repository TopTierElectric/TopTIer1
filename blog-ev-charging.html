      <h2>EV Charging at Home</h2>
      <p>Your personal guide to powering up your electric vehicle in West Michigan.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <article class="blog-post">
    <div class="container">
      <p>If you’re reading this, chances are you’re either shopping for an electric vehicle or already own one and want to make charging at home as smooth and economical as possible. I’m the owner of <strong>Top Tier Electrical</strong> here in Allegan, Michigan, and over the past few years my team and I have installed dozens of home EV chargers around West Michigan. We’ve seen what works, what doesn’t, and what you can expect along the way. This post is my attempt to share that knowledge in a friendly, straightforward way.</p>

      <h2>Why Level&nbsp;2 Is the Sweet Spot</h2>
      <p>A standard Level 1 charger—what you get when you plug the car into a normal wall outlet—adds roughly <strong>3–5 miles of range per hour</strong>. That’s fine for short commutes, plug‑in hybrids or as a backup. Most of our customers end up wanting a <strong>Level 2</strong> charger, which runs on 240 volts and can add <strong>15–50+ miles of range per hour</strong>, depending on the vehicle and the charger’s amperage. It’s the sweet spot because it fully charges most EVs overnight without putting undue strain on your electrical system.</p>
      <p>Public DC fast chargers—the ones you see at highway rest stops—are designed for road trips. They’re expensive to install, and the power draw is enormous, so they don’t make sense for home use.</p>

      <h2>Our Installation Process, Step by Step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Site check &amp; load calculation:</strong> We start by looking at what you already have running on your electrical service—range, dryer, HVAC, hot tub and so on—and perform a National Electrical Code (NEC) dwelling load calculation. Because EV charging is considered a continuous load, we size the circuit at <strong>125 percent</strong> of the charger’s rated current.</li>
        <li><strong>Choosing the charger:</strong> Together we decide whether to hardwire the charging station or install a plug‑in unit (NEMA 14‑50 or 6‑50). Hardwired EVSEs look tidier and often avoid the nuisance GFCI trips that some plug‑in combos can cause, but plug‑in units give you portability.</li>
        <li><strong>Permitting &amp; installation:</strong> We pull the necessary permits, install the dedicated circuit, mount and wire the charger, and then schedule a final inspection. We work in Allegan, Holland, Grand Rapids and all over West Michigan, so we’re familiar with local inspectors and utility requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Commissioning &amp; rate setup:</strong> After inspection, we walk you through the charger’s settings (many units have adjustable current limits) and help enroll you in any off‑peak or EV time‑of‑use rate your utility offers.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Do You Really Need a Panel or Service Upgrade?</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest misconceptions is that every EV charger installation requires a new electrical panel or a 200 amp service. In reality, we can often avoid an upgrade by running the numbers. We check two things: panel capacity—is there space (and bus capacity) for another two‑pole breaker?—and service capacity. Many homes with 100‑150 amp services can support a 32–40 amp Level 2 charger if gas appliances handle most of the heavy lifting. If your service is 60 amps or you have multiple electric appliances, we may recommend derating the charger, using load‑sharing features or planning for an upgrade.</p>
      <p>Here are some rules of thumb based on what we’ve seen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>200 amp service:</strong> One high‑output Level 2 charger is usually no problem; two will often work if the chargers share power intelligently.</li>
        <li><strong>100‑150 amp service:</strong> A 32–40 amp charger is often fine with a proper calculation or an energy‑management system.</li>
        <li><strong>60‑100 amp service:</strong> You’ll likely need to dial back the charger’s amperage or consider a service upgrade.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Breaker and Circuit Sizing Made Simple</h2>
      <p>EV charging is a continuous load under the NEC, which means your circuit and breaker must be sized at <strong>125 percent</strong> of the EVSE’s nameplate current. Here’s a quick reference:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Charger output</th><th>Minimum breaker size</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>32 amps</td><td>40 amp breaker</td></tr>
          <tr><td>40 amps</td><td>50 amp breaker</td></tr>
          <tr><td>48 amps</td><td>60 amp breaker</td></tr>
          <tr><td>80 amps</td><td>100 amp breaker</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Plug‑In vs Hardwired Chargers</h2>
      <p><strong>Plug‑in chargers</strong> use a receptacle like a NEMA 14‑50 (common for RVs) or NEMA 6‑50 (common for welders). They’re great if you plan to take your charger with you when you move. The downside is that detached garages almost always require GFCI protection, and some charger‑receptacle combos can nuisance trip.</p>
      <p><strong>Hardwired chargers</strong> are permanently installed. They look cleaner on the wall, include their own GFCI protection and rarely nuisance trip. The trade‑off is that you can’t easily unplug them if you relocate.</p>

      <h2>Powering Two EVs at One House</h2>
      <p>With multiple EVs in a household becoming more common, we’ve had to get creative. Here are three options that have worked well for our clients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Power sharing:</strong> Some brands sell matching wall connectors that communicate with each other. They split the available current between two vehicles and adjust as one finishes charging.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy‑management systems:</strong> These devices limit the combined load of all EV chargers in your home so you don’t exceed your service rating.</li>
        <li><strong>Panel expansion or service upgrade:</strong> When the math doesn’t work—say you want two 48 amp chargers on a 100 amp service—we’ll help you plan a panel upgrade or a full service upgrade, including utility coordination.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changing Connectors: J3400 (NACS) vs CCS</h2>
      <p>The North American EV connector landscape is shifting. Most automakers are moving from CCS to SAE J3400 (often called NACS). Don’t worry—the plug itself is chosen by your charger and your car. We design our installations to be future‑proof, so if you replace your vehicle or EVSE down the road, you won’t need a new circuit.</p>

      <h2>Rebates, Rates and Incentives</h2>
      <p>Both Consumers Energy and DTE Energy offer EV time‑of‑use rates and occasionally rebates for installing a Level 2 charger. These programs change regularly, so we always verify the current terms when preparing your quote. In past years, we’ve helped clients apply for rebates that offset a portion of the installation cost. As part of our service, we’ll help you with the paperwork and make sure you’re enrolled in the right rate plan.</p>

      <h2>What It Typically Costs</h2>
      <p>Every home is different, but here’s a ballpark range based on dozens of installations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard Level 2 install:</strong> customer‑provided EVSE, up to 50 amps, short run in garage – around $500–$900 before incentives.</li>
        <li><strong>Panel work, sub‑panel or longer feeder runs:</strong> additional cost based on the scope; we’ll quote after a quick site visit.</li>
        <li><strong>200 amp panel/service upgrades:</strong> quoted after a detailed load calculation and coordination with the utility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We provide an upfront quote and never recommend unnecessary upgrades. If a simpler solution will save you money, we’ll tell you.</p>

      <h2>Answers to Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>How fast will my EV charge?</h3>
      <p>Multiply the charger’s power (kW) by your vehicle’s efficiency (typically 3–4 miles per kWh). For example, a 9.6 kW charger adds roughly <strong>30–40 miles of range per hour</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Can I just add a 14‑50 receptacle?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes yes, especially if you plan to use a portable charger. However, we still need to run a load calculation, and GFCI protection is usually required in garages. Many owners choose a hardwired charger for peace of mind.</p>
      <h3>What if I have two EVs and only a 200 amp service?</h3>
      <p>Load sharing or an energy‑management system often solves this problem without a full service upgrade.</p>
      <h3>Do I really need a permit?</h3>
      <p>Yes—most municipalities require one. We pull the permit and make sure your installation is up to code and ready for inspection.</p>
